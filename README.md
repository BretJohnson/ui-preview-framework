# Overview

The Example Framework lets you easily work on pages/controls in your app in isolation, without the
need to run the app, navigate to the page, and supply any test data.

Examples are similar stories in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for JavaScript and Previews in
[SwiftUI/Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/previewing-your-apps-interface-in-xcode)
and [Jetpack Compose/Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tooling/previews) -
but for .NET UI.

The framework itself is cross platform, intended to work with (most) any .NET UI platform -
it has a platform agnostic piece and platform specific piece, with the platform piece pluggable.
Initial support is for .NET MAUI.

## How to use (MAUI version)

Add a reference to the `PreviewFramework.Maui` NuGet to your app (once that NuGet is published - it isn't yet so you'll need to use this repo instead).

Add this line to your `App` constructor (needed for now):

```
#if PREVIEWS
    MauiPreviewApplication.EnsureInitialized();
#endif
```

With just that, if you open your app in a tool that supports it (like what we're addning to Visual Studio) you we'll see previews automatically created for some of pages/controls.
Previews are automatically created for:

- Pages: Derives (directly or indirectly) from `Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Page` and has a constructor that takes no parameters (no view model required).,
- Controls: Dervies from `Microsoft.Maui.Controls.View` (and isn't a page), again with a constructor that takes no parameters.

That should get you started. Beyond that, you'll probably want to define previews yourself, which lets you:

- Support any UI component (not just with zero argument constructors)
- Provide sample data
- Define multiple previews for a single UI component

Defining your own previews isn't hard & is similar to what's done in SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose. To do it, add a static to your UI component class (in code behind with XAML) with the `[Preview]` attribute, like below. Instantiate the control, passing in a view model with sample data or whatever the constructor requires.

```C#
#if PREVIEWS
    [Preview]
    public static ConfirmAddressView Preview() => new(PreviewData.GetPreviewProducts(1), new DeliveryTypeModel(),
        new AddressModel()
        {
            StreetOne = "21, Alex Davidson Avenue",
            StreetTwo = "Opposite Omegatron, Vicent Quarters",
            City = "Victoria Island",
            State = "Lagos State"
        });
#endif
```

You can define multiple methods for multiple previews, like:

```C#
#if PREVIEWS
    [Preview("0 cards")]
    public static CardView NoCards() => new(PreviewData.GetPreviewCards(0));

    [Preview("1 card")]
    public static CardView SingleCard() => new(PreviewData.GetPreviewCards(1));

    [Preview("2 cards")]
    public static CardView TwoCards() => new(PreviewData.GetPreviewCards(2));

    [Preview("6 cards")]
    public static CardView SixCards() => new(PreviewData.GetPreviewCards(6));
#endif
```

The `[Preview]` argument is the optional display name - without that, the name
is method name.

Names really just matter when you have a multiple previews. If there's just one,
then by convention it's named `Preview`, but it doesn't matter as the tooling
displays the UI component name instead.

## How to build

In brief, run `init.ps1` then open the solution. For details see [Contibuting](Contributing.md)
